# Versions

Alerse has its own version, `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, the same on every platform
(0.1.0 to 0.1.7 were released under the project's earlier name, Arcomium, which
stored settings still use: `arcomium.*`). A
release is tagged `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` in each platform repository; its packages
carry that version in their names.

`VERSION` holds the newest release's version: a release raises it in its
`chore(release): X.Y.Z` commit, and that commit gets the tag. Development is on the 0.1
line: each release raises the patch number. The minor number goes up only when the
project decides on it.

To make a release, follow [releasing.md](releasing.md).

## Releases

A release is titled "Alerse X.Y.Z for <platform>" and its notes name the
Chromium version it is built on. Every release carries its files: on Windows the
x64 and arm64 installers and portable zips, on Linux the AppImages, their `.zsync`
files and tar.xz, on macOS the arm64 dmg (pre-releases so far), and `SHA256SUMS` over
all of them. The platform repositories' release workflows
publish each architecture as soon as it is built (`publish.yml`, `gh release
upload --clobber`) and rewrite `SHA256SUMS` from every file of the release, so one
architecture never waits for the other. A Windows x64 build made locally may be
uploaded first, so a release is downloadable before CI finishes; CI then replaces
those files under the same names. Package names come from the tag, not from the
stamped Chromium version: `alerse_<tag>_...`.

| Release | Platforms | Chromium | What it brought |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.1.0 | macOS (pre-release) | 156.0.8078.79 | Not published on Windows or Linux (its build was cancelled) |
| 0.1.1 | Windows, Linux | 156.0.8078.79 | First Windows release (local x64 build without PGO) and first Linux release |
| 0.1.2 | Windows | 157.0.8103.38 | Chromium 157, its own install identity, end-to-end-only sync, PGO |
| 0.1.3 | Windows | 157.0.8103.38 | Built-in import from Arc and other browsers |
| 0.1.4 | Windows | 157.0.8103.3804 | Per-release version numbers, the new-version notice, the tab speaker, DevTools fixed, older `arc_import.py` imports taken over |
| 0.1.5 | Windows | 157.0.8103.3805 | Tabs opened from pinned items stay on them across restarts, reopened tabs and restored groups |
| 0.1.6 | Windows | 157.0.8103.3806 | Command bar actions and shortcuts, Split View (keys, menus, drag a tab onto a tab or the page edge), Arc's icon pickers for Spaces, pinned items, folders and favorites; macOS look and menus matched to Arc |
| 0.1.7 | macOS (pre-release) | 156.0.8078.7907 | Last release under the earlier name. First official macOS build (ThinLTO, PGO) since 0.1.0, with the changes of 0.1.1 to 0.1.6 that apply to it; Rename Space titled "Edit Space name", the Space bar's Downloads button in place of the archive |

Linux gets the changes from 0.1.2 on with its first release on Chromium 157.

## The Chromium version inside the browser

Each release gets its own Chromium version number: Windows' installer cannot
install a version over itself while the browser runs, so two releases on the
same Chromium could not update each other. `tools/rename_product.py`, which
every platform runs over the patched tree, writes the release's patch number
into the last two digits of `chrome/VERSION`'s PATCH:

    PATCH = Chromium's PATCH x 100 + the release's PATCH

Release 0.1.4 on Chromium 157.0.8103.38 is 157.0.8103.3804. `chrome://version`,
the Windows file version and install directory, and the macOS bundle version
show it. Websites do not: the User-Agent, its client hints and
`navigator.userAgentData` report Chromium's version, 157.0.8103.38, which
`chrome/VERSION` keeps as UPSTREAM_PATCH
(`patches/defaults/upstream-web-version.patch`). Release notes name Chromium's
version, as in "Alerse 0.1.8, Chromium 157.0.8103.38".

The numbers only grow when:

- The release's PATCH stays below 100; the script refuses 100 and up.
- The release's PATCH does not go down while Chromium's version stays: a
  release that raises its MINOR or MAJOR on the same Chromium keeps
  counting the patch number (0.1.7 is followed by 0.2.8, not 0.2.0), or comes
  with a newer Chromium. A newer Chromium outranks every earlier stamp. The
  platform repositories' release workflows (`.github/scripts/release-version.sh`)
  compare the stamp with that of the latest release, whose notes name its
  Chromium, and fail before building when it is not higher.
- Chromium's PATCH is at most 655, or the stamp no longer fits in the 16 bits
  of a Windows file version; the script refuses it too. Stable Chromium
  patch numbers stay far below that.
- Every release raises `VERSION`, a release of one platform repository
  too: the release workflows accept only the tag `v` + `VERSION`, as the
  update check below needs.

Up to 0.1.3 every release had Chromium's own number, so installing one over a
running browser failed (installer exit code 7) and rolled back.

Stamping runs again safely: when `chrome/VERSION` already has UPSTREAM_PATCH, the
script takes Chromium's PATCH from it instead of stamping twice. Linux copies the
core's `VERSION` into its build container for this. The stamped version still shows
outside the browser in one place: the `prodversion` of extension and component
update checks.

## Telling about a newer release

`tools/rename_product.py` also writes the release into `chrome/VERSION` as
ALERSE_VERSION, and `chrome/browser/alerse_update` compiles it in. Once a
day the browser reads the `tag_name` of the platform repository's latest
GitHub release and, when that `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` is above its own version,
shows "Update to Alerse MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH" at the top of its menus
(builds of 0.1.7 and before find the same releases: the repositories were renamed,
and GitHub redirects their old names). So the
tag of every release must be its `VERSION`, with a `v`; drafts and
pre-releases are not "latest" and are not offered. macOS is the exception: its
releases are all pre-releases while it trails Windows' Chromium version, so there
the browser reads the last twenty releases and takes the newest that is not a
draft (`NewestRelease()`), or it would never offer an update. A build whose
`chrome/VERSION` has no ALERSE_VERSION does not check, nor does a browser
in headless mode or started with `--disable-background-networking`.

Any answer from GitHub counts, one with no release or with a tag that is
not `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` too (the last release found stays): the next check
is a day later. Only no answer at all, GitHub's rate limit (HTTP 403, 429)
or a server error (5xx) is retried an hour later.

The Local State pref `arcomium.update_check.enabled` (true by default) turns
the check off; `arcomium.update_check.latest` and `.last_time` keep the last
answer, so the menu item survives restarts until the newer release is
installed.
