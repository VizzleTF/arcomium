<h1 align="center">Alerse</h1>

<p align="center">A sidebar browser for people moving from Arc, built on ungoogled-chromium.</p>

Alerse gives you a vertical sidebar, Spaces with separate logins in one window, a
command bar and sync you can host yourself. Its name is a free spelling of alerce, the
Chilean tree.

This repository holds what all platforms share: the Chromium patches, the design notes
and a fallback Arc import script. Builds come from the platform repositories.

## Install

| Platform | Download | First start |
|---|---|---|
| Windows 10 and 11 (x64, arm64) | installer or zip from [alerse-win releases](https://github.com/VizzleTF/alerse-win/releases) | SmartScreen warns about an unsigned app: More info, Run anyway |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `.dmg` from [alerse-mac releases](https://github.com/VizzleTF/alerse-mac/releases) | drag Alerse to Applications, then run `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Alerse.app` |
| Linux (x86_64, arm64) | AppImage or tarball from [alerse-linux releases](https://github.com/VizzleTF/alerse-linux/releases): 0.1.1 only, before Space profiles; the next waits for ungoogled-chromium 157 on Linux | `chmod +x` the AppImage |
| iPhone | build from source: [alerse-ios](https://github.com/VizzleTF/alerse-ios) | |

Alerse tells you about a newer release in the Alerse menu (the logo at the top of the
sidebar; on macOS the Alerse menu of the menu bar); you install it yourself.

## Features

- **The sidebar**: Space name, pinned items in nested folders, open tabs under
  collapsed folders, a popup of a folder's links on hover, New Tab, then the Space's tabs.
  Arc's icon pickers give pinned items, folders and Spaces a glyph (Spaces also an
  emoji), and the Space menu collapses or expands all folders at once.

  ![The icon picker for a Space: Arc's glyphs and emoji](docs/images/icon-picker.png)

 
  As in Arc, a hovered pinned item's "−" closes its tab and keeps the item, and with no
  tab open its "×" removes the item.
- **Spaces**: each Space is a profile of its own, with its own cookies, logins, history
  and extensions, so you can be logged into different accounts side by side. The
  Spaces' windows sit in one place and switching shows the next one, so they look like
  one window. Spaces survive restarts. To move a tab or a pinned item to another Space,
  drag it onto that Space's icon in the Space bar, or use Move to in its menu.

  ![The Work Space, switched to from the Space bar at the bottom of the sidebar](docs/images/spaces.png)
- **Sync on your terms**: bookmarks, tabs, Spaces, passwords and settings through an
  [alerse-sync](https://github.com/VizzleTF/alerse-sync) server, end-to-end
  encrypted. Best on a server of your own, which runs in Docker or Kubernetes; the Alerse
  server is there for those who would rather not run one, offered voluntarily and without
  any responsibility for the data on it. A new device signs in with the 24 words and a
  password; neither alone opens the account, and a lost device can be removed. Set it up
  from **Sync** in the Alerse menu.
- **Command bar actions**: type a command's name in the command bar to run it, as in
  Arc: Copy URL, Copy URL as Markdown or as Quote, Pin or Unpin Tab, New Space, Rename
  Space, Edit Theme, New Folder, Collapse Pinned Tabs, Reveal Tab in Sidebar, View
  History, Settings and more, each with its shortcut.

  ![The command bar finding Copy URL and Copy URL as Markdown](docs/images/command-bar.png)

  Arc's keys too: Ctrl+Shift+C (Shift+Cmd+C) copies the address,
  Ctrl+Shift+Alt+C (Option+Shift+Cmd+C) copies it as a Markdown link, Ctrl+D (Cmd+D)
  pins or unpins the tab.
- **Split View**: two pages side by side, as in Arc. Ctrl+Shift+= (Control+Shift+= on
  a Mac) adds a pane and opens the command bar to fill it; Ctrl+Shift+- closes the
  shown pane, Ctrl+Shift+1 and 2 switch panes. Drag a tab onto another tab in the
  sidebar, or onto the page's edge, to split the two; the sidebar shows a split as
  one row, and dragging a pane out of it separates it. Also Open in Split View in the
  sidebar's menus and the split items of the View menu (macOS) or the Alerse menu.

  ![GitHub and Wikipedia side by side in Split View](docs/images/split-view.png)
- **Arc's menu bar on macOS**: File, Edit, View, Spaces, Tabs, Archive, Extensions,
  Window and Help with Arc's items and keys: the Spaces menu lists your Spaces
  (Control+1 to 9), the Extensions menu your extensions, Cmd+1 to 9 open the sidebar's
  items, Copy URL as Quote copies a selection with its link. The sidebar's menus have
  Arc's Share (AirDrop, Mail, Messages...) and a folder's Share Folder....
- **Link routing**: links from other apps open in the Space you choose for their site,
  such as github.com in Work.
- **Media**: a mini player at the bottom of the sidebar for media playing in another
  tab, and picture-in-picture when you leave a playing video.
- **Import from Arc and other browsers**: Arc's Spaces, pinned tabs, nested folders and
  icons, and the bookmarks of Chrome, Edge, Brave, Vivaldi, Opera, Yandex Browser and
  Chromium, built in, with their Chrome Web Store extensions.
- **Peek and the Little window**: Shift+click a link, or click a link to another site
  in a pinned tab, and it opens over the page; Ctrl+Alt+N (Option-Command-N) opens a
  small window, where links from other apps open too. Both can be turned off on the
  Link routing page.
- **Netflix on macOS**: streaming sites with DRM open in a WebKit view inside the tab,
  which plays them with Apple's FairPlay.

## Differences from Arc

- **No account and no AI.** Nothing signs in to a company, and there is no assistant,
  summaries or AI search.
- **ungoogled-chromium underneath**, with its privacy defaults (see [Privacy](#privacy)).
- **Sync of its own**, end-to-end encrypted on the Alerse server or one you run
  ([alerse-sync](https://github.com/VizzleTF/alerse-sync)): an account opens with the 24
  words and a password, each device has a key of its own, and a recovery sheet keeps
  the words safe.
- **Windows looks like Arc for macOS** everywhere except the top bar, which stays Arc
  for Windows': the sidebar, Space bar, popovers, folder popup, page card, hidden
  sidebar and command bar are the Mac's.
- **Downloads instead of the Library** at the left of the Space bar.
- **Boosts**: your own look for a site (colors, dark, font, size, parts zapped away,
  your CSS), from the site controls or Boost This Site in the command bar.
- **Not built**: Easels and the tab archive.

## Move from Arc

Open the Alerse menu (the logo at the top of the sidebar; on macOS the menu bar's) and
pick **Import from Another Browser...**, or go to `chrome://alerse-import`. The page
lists what it finds on this computer, with an **Import** button for each:

- **Arc** (Windows and macOS): every Space with its pinned tabs, nested folders, folder
  icons and cached favicons. The first Space goes to Home; each of the others becomes a
  Space in the Space bar.
- **Chrome, Edge, Brave, Vivaldi, Opera, Yandex Browser, Chromium** (Windows, macOS,
  Linux), each profile on its own: the bookmarks go to a folder named after the browser
  (and the profile, when there are several), pinned in the current Space.

Alerse only reads the other browsers' files, so they can stay open. Importing a source
again replaces what it brought in before. For Firefox, Safari or an HTML bookmarks file,
the page links to the standard importer.

Fallback, for a profile Alerse is not running on: close Alerse and run
`python tools\arc_import.py` (Python 3, Windows). It writes to home's profile,
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Alerse\User Data\Default`, or to the one `--profile` names. It writes the same Arc bookmarks
straight into the profile's `Bookmarks` file, replacing what it or the import page
imported before. Arc's first Space goes to home; when Alerse starts, each other Arc Space
becomes a Space of its own with its pinned items.

## Privacy

Alerse keeps ungoogled-chromium's privacy defaults, with these exceptions:

| Exception | What reaches Google | Off by |
|---|---|---|
| Google is the default search engine | Your searches, only when you search | Picking another engine in the Alerse menu, Search Engine |
| Search suggestions can be turned on | What you type in the address bar | They are off unless you turn them on in settings |
| The Chrome Web Store installs and updates extensions | Installed extensions' IDs and versions, in update checks | Not installing extensions from the Web Store |

Alerse has no updater. A few minutes after it starts, and then once a day, it
asks GitHub's API for the platform's latest release: a plain GET of
`api.github.com/repos/VizzleTF/alerse-<platform>/releases/latest`, without
cookies. When the release is newer, the Alerse menu shows "Update to Alerse X.Y.Z", which opens the release's page; nothing
is downloaded by itself.

Beta releases are GitHub pre-releases. To be told about them too, check Developer,
Beta Updates in the Alerse menu: the check then asks for `/releases?per_page=20` and takes
the newest. On macOS every release is a pre-release for now, so it always does. To turn the check off, quit Alerse and set
`"arcomium": {"update_check": {"enabled": false}}` (`arcomium` is Alerse's earlier
name, kept in stored settings) in the `Local State` file of
Alerse's user data folder (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Alerse\User Data` on Windows).
Headless mode and `--disable-background-networking` turn it off too.

Besides these, the sync server you set up and the Web Store, Alerse makes no network
requests of its own.

What the same defaults leave out, so that you can decide knowingly:

- **No Safe Browsing.** Alerse does not check pages or downloads against Google's
  lists of phishing and malware, and it saves downloads without asking. Be as careful
  with a download as you would be without a browser's warning.
- **No background security data.** Chrome fetches certificate revocation lists and
  the list of Certificate Transparency logs between releases; Alerse has no component
  updater, so these are as old as the build. Chromium stops enforcing Certificate
  Transparency about ten weeks after a build was made.
- **Security fixes arrive with releases only.** Alerse follows ungoogled-chromium,
  which follows Chrome's stable channel by some days, and does not update itself. Keep
  to the latest release; a build more than a few weeks old is missing fixes.

ungoogled-chromium rewrites Google domains in the source after the patches apply. The
Web Store's addresses in `extensions/web-store.patch` are written split
(`"clients2.goo" "gle.com"`) so that this rewriting leaves them working.
